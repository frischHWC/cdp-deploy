# Deploy to CDP

This project is an ansible playbook that "deploy" to CDP a given project by making automatic substitution of parameters to configuration files, by taking parameters from CM.

Its intent is to reduce burden of configuration files between environment by allowing to use only variables automatically filled during deployment.

It is also an "easy" way to deploy projects to CDP.


## Requirements

__N.B.: It is recommended to use anaconda on your computer and activate an ansible environment __

- Have Ansible installed in version >= 2.10 

- Have a running and working CDP cluster with CM APIs access


## How to run it ?

First, configure the project using link:extra_vars.yml[extra_vars.yml] file, at least cloudera-manager host should be filled.

Run the project using this ansible command: 

        ansible-playbook -i "${YOUR_EDGE_HOST}" main.yml --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml"

__N.B.: This playbook could run locally or on any machine (including the ones of the cluster)__


## How does it work  ?

It will clone the given project to the node you specified, gather configuration from CM and filled in the configuration files specified with those variables.

Then, an optionnal compilation could be made.
